Welcome! This is the research blog of Mark van der Laan.

Over the last few years, communication in science has evolved; indeed, many
exciting and inspiring research-related ideas are now first communicated
informally, with blog posts and the like, before formal publication in academic
journals. Blog posts provide an excellent medium through which interesting
ideas can be communicated quickly and concisely. We plan to use this blog to
share ideas, tips, and examples from our research -- and to establish an open
dialogue with researchers around the world.

Here are a few topics we hope to write about
* Key concepts in the practice of statistics
* The role of machine learning in causal inference
* Targeted Learning as a methodology for empowering science
* How to clearly delineate a statistical estimation problem
* Applications of statistical and causal inference in the real world
* Computationally intensive methods for inference

As part of this effort, we invite interested readers to submit questions to be
answered by Dr. Mark van der Laan. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, not
all questions will be answered but we hope to answer as many questions as time
permits.
